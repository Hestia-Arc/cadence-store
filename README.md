 **LeCadence Home-Decor E-commerce Store**

**Overview**

An e-commerce store built with React, Typescript, TailwindCSS, Reduxtoolkit & Framer-motion.

 Got the beautiful UI template from https://www.figma.com/@Jenkate

I'm taking a step further to develop the backend and also explore monorepo (in development).

**Features**
- **Intuitive Interface:** Enjoy a user-friendly and responsive interface that facilitates easy shopping experience.

- **Optional Payment Management (Advanced):** Integrate payment gateways (if implemented) for seamless money transfers (consider PayPal or Stripe for future development).

**Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hestia-Arc/cadence-store.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd cadence-store
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will typically start the development server on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the project configuration). You can then access the application in your web browser.

**Development Environment**

***Technologies Used***
